*The 2023 Rural-urban Continuum Codes classify metropolitan counties (codes 1 through 3) by the population of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and nonmetropolitan counties (codes 4 through 9) by degree of urbanization and proximity to metro areas. See rural-urban continuum codes for precise definitions of each code.
